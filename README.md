RotMG ProCursor
==============

## Synopsis

RotMG ProCursor is a set of mouse cursors and an (optional) AutoHotKey script to automatically switch to a cursor only when playing Realm of the Mad God.

## Motivation

Realm of the Mad Gods is known for it's chaotic and risky battles with sometimes thousands of different sprites and effects happening on the screen. With such a busy screen, it is much easier to lose a simple cursor so a cursor that you can easily see no matter what exactly is happening in game is definetly needed.

## AutoHotKey Auto-Enable-Cursor

A ProCursor.ahk [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) script is included. When this script is running, it will automatically switch to your ProCursor if your RotMG window is open and will switch back to your previous pointer once you switch windows. Below are the instructions on how to install.

 * If not already installed, install [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/).
 * Navigate to [https://github.com/Atroxide/ProCursor/releases](https://github.com/Atroxide/ProCursor/releases) and download the ZIP archive of the latest version of ProCursor.
 * After downloading, unextract and place the directory anywhere you would like to.
 * Navigate inside the ProCursor directory and if you have AHK installed, you will get a "run script" when you right click on the "ProCursor.ahk" file.
 
If you would like to change which of the RotMG ProCursors you are using or which hotkey temporarily disables the cursor, open "ProCursor.ahk" in a text editor such as notepad and change the "hotkey_to_disable" and "cursor_style" variables. After changing and saving- in your tooltray, right click the AutoHotKey icon and select "reload script".

## Use Without AutoHotKey

If you prefer the cursor to not automatically switch when playing RotMG, you can still use RotMG ProCursor. Below are the instructions on how to install one of the cursors in Windows 7. Other Windows version should be similar if not the same.

 * Navigate to [https://github.com/Atroxide/ProCursor/releases](https://github.com/Atroxide/ProCursor/releases) and download the ZIP archive of the latest version of ProCursor.
 * After downloading, unextract and place the directory anywhere you would like to.
 * Right click your desktop and select "Personalize".
 * In the left column, click on "Change mouse pointers".
 * In the "Pointers" column, under Customize (With "Normal Select" selected), click on "Browse".
 * Browse to where you you extracted the ProCursor/ directory and go into the cursors/ sub directory.
 * Select any of the cursors and click Apply.
 * To switch back to your regular cursor, in the Pointers Menu, click on "Use Default".
 * If you prefer to not have to do this manually each time you play, the previous section titled "AutoHotKey Auto-Enable Cursor" will take care of it for you.
